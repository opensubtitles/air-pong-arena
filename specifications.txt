# AIR PONG ARENA - Complete Game Design Specification

## Core Concept
A competitive multiplayer Pong evolution where players use their hands as physical paddles in 3D space. The camera tracks hand positions and gestures to control glowing energy paddles that deflect balls in a neon-lit arena.

## Camera & Hand Tracking System

### Initialization & Calibration
1. **Welcome Screen**: Players position themselves 60-90cm from camera
2. **Hand Calibration Sequence**:
   - Show both open palms facing camera for 2 seconds
   - System maps hand size, reach limits, and tracking boundaries
   - Detect player's comfortable movement range (shoulder width, vertical reach)
   - Create personalized "control zone" - your physical space = your paddle zone
   - Visual feedback: green outline when hands properly detected, red when lost
3. **Tracking Requirements**:
   - Track both hands simultaneously (MediaPipe Hands or similar)
   - Detect palm position (X, Y, Z depth)
   - Recognize open palm vs closed fist vs pinch gesture
   - Track hand rotation/tilt for advanced paddle angles
   - 60fps minimum for responsive gameplay

### Hand Control Mapping
- **Open Palm** = Active paddle (glowing, solid)
- **Closed Fist** = Paddle charges energy (pulsing effect)
- **Pinch Gesture** (thumb + index) = Grab power-ups floating nearby
- **Clap** (both hands touch) = Activate equipped power-up
- **Hand Tilt/Rotation** = Paddle angle for ball spin control
- **Depth (Z-axis)** = Paddle size (closer = smaller/faster, further = larger/slower)

## Game Modes & Player Configurations

### 2-Player Mode (Classic)
- Top vs Bottom paddles
- Each player uses ONE hand as paddle
- Arena: rectangular, classic Pong style with neon edges
- Camera can capture both players if sitting side-by-side

### 4-Player Mode (Arena Battle)
- Square arena with 4 walls
- Each player controls one wall-side
- Camera setup: 
  - **Option A**: All 4 players around one device (tablet on table)
  - **Option B**: 4 connected devices, each player on their screen
- Ball bounces between all 4 sides
- Eliminate players when ball passes their paddle 3 times
- Last 2 standing = final duel

### 6-Player Mode (Hexagon Chaos)
- Hexagonal arena with 6 sides
- Faster, more chaotic gameplay
- 2 balls in play simultaneously
- Perfect for party mode
- Requires larger screen or multiple connected devices

### 8-Player Mode (Octagon Madness)
- Maximum chaos mode
- 3 balls in play
- Smaller paddles, faster ball speed
- Survival style: first to 5 deaths eliminated
- Spectator cameras show all players gesturing wildly

### Team Mode (2v2 or 3v3)
- Players on same side collaborate
- Shared lives pool
- Can pass ball between teammates by timing paddles
- Combined power-ups for team synergy

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Ball Physics
- **Base Ball**: Classic bouncing with slight speed increase per hit
- **Trajectory**: Paddle angle + movement direction affects ball spin
- **Speed Tiers**: 
  - Level 1: 300px/s (warm-up)
  - Level 2: 500px/s (intense)
  - Level 3: 800px/s (expert)
  - Level 4: 1200px/s (insane)
- **Spin System**: Swipe hand while hitting = curve ball trajectory
- **Multi-ball Events**: 2-5 balls appear randomly after 30 seconds

### Paddle Mechanics
- **Size**: Based on hand distance from camera (Z-depth)
  - Far = 150px wide, slow response
  - Mid = 100px wide, balanced
  - Close = 60px wide, lightning fast
- **Energy System**: Hold closed fist for 2 seconds = charged paddle
  - Charged hit = ball temporarily 2x faster toward opponent
  - Visual: paddle glows brighter, leaves particle trail
- **Shield Mode**: Open both palms wide = temporary 2x paddle size (3 sec cooldown)

## Power-Up System

### Power-Up Spawning
- Appear as floating glowing orbs every 15-20 seconds
- Float near paddle zones (within reach)
- Grab with pinch gesture
- Hold max 1 power-up, activate with clap gesture
- Color-coded for visibility

### Offensive Power-Ups (Red)
1. **Fireball**: Ball leaves fire trail, 1.5x speed, burns through shields
2. **Multi-Shot**: Split ball into 3 balls for 10 seconds
3. **Sniper Shot**: Ultra-fast thin laser ball, hard to see/track
4. **Gravity Well**: Ball curves toward your paddle for 8 seconds
5. **EMP Blast**: Opponent's paddle frozen for 2 seconds

### Defensive Power-Ups (Blue)
1. **Force Field**: Full wall coverage for 5 seconds
2. **Time Slow**: Ball moves 50% slower for 8 seconds (your view only)
3. **Magnet Paddle**: Auto-attracts ball within 20px radius
4. **Ghost Paddle**: Create temporary second paddle for 6 seconds
5. **Reverser**: Ball bounces back from your wall automatically once

### Chaos Power-Ups (Purple)
1. **Size Swap**: All paddles swap sizes for 10 seconds
2. **Invisible Ball**: Ball becomes 80% transparent for 5 seconds
3. **Gravity Flip**: Ball physics inverted (bounces weirdly)
4. **Mirror Maze**: Ball creates visual duplicates (only 1 real)
5. **Blackout**: All arena lights dim, only ball glows

### Ultimate Power-Ups (Gold - Rare)
1. **Devastator**: Massive energy blast eliminates all balls, spawns new one toward chosen opponent
2. **Time Stop**: Freeze all balls for 3 seconds, reposition paddle freely
3. **Wormhole**: Create portal - ball enters yours, exits from opponent's wall
4. **Supernova**: Ball explodes into 8 balls radiating in all directions

## Multiplayer Connection & Player Discovery

### Connection Modes

#### Local Multi-Device Mode (Primary - Most Viral)
**Setup Flow**:
1. **Host Creates Room**:
   - Click "Create Game" → generates 6-digit room code (e.g., "4X7K2M")
   - QR code displayed on screen
   - Host selects game mode (2/4/6/8 players)
   - Host's device becomes the "game server"

2. **Players Join**:
   - Other players open game on their devices
   - Click "Join Game" → enter room code OR scan QR code
   - Camera permission requested for hand tracking
   - Each player sees "Waiting for players..." lobby

3. **Lobby System**:
   - Show all connected players with their camera feeds (small thumbnails)
   - Each player picks their paddle color (first-come selection)
   - Host sees "Ready" checkmarks as players calibrate hands
   - Host clicks "Start Game" when all ready

4. **Arena Assignment**:
   - 4-player: Players assigned to Top/Right/Bottom/Left based on join order
   - 6-player: Hexagon sides clockwise from host
   - 8-player: Octagon sides clockwise from host
   - Visual diagram shows "You are BLUE paddle on RIGHT side"

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// WebRTC peer-to-peer mesh network
- Host device = signaling server + game state authority
- PeerJS or simple-peer for WebRTC connections
- You can run simple node.js server, which I run locally act as bridge
- Each device streams: hand tracking data (60fps) + camera feed (15fps)
- Host device runs physics simulation, broadcasts ball position to all
- Each client renders game based on host's authoritative state
- Latency compensation: predict local paddle position, sync every 100ms
```

#### Same-Device Mode (Party Mode)
**Setup Flow**:
1. Place tablet/large phone on table
2. Select "Local Party" mode
3. Choose player count (2-4 max for single device)
4. Players sit around device in positions shown on screen
5. Each player calibrates hands in their zone
6. Camera detects multiple hand pairs simultaneously

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// MediaPipe Hands with multi-hand tracking
- Detect up to 4 hand pairs (8 hands total)
- Spatial zones: divide camera view into quadrants
- Assign hands to players based on screen position
- Each quadrant = one player's control zone
- Works best on tablets (10"+ screens)
```

#### Online Matchmaking (Advanced)
**Setup Flow**:
1. **Quick Match**:
   - Click "Find Game"
   - Matchmaking based on: skill level, region (ping <100ms)
   - 15-second countdown while finding players
   - Auto-start when lobby fills

2. **Ranked Mode**:
   - ELO-based matchmaking
   - Rank tiers: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond
   - Seasonal leaderboards

3. **Private Lobbies**:
   - Share permanent friend code
   - Create password-protected rooms
   - Tournament organizer mode (bracket management)

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Backend required (Firebase Realtime Database or similar)
- Centralized matchmaking queue
- Room state synchronized via WebSocket
- STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal
- Dedicated relay server for >4 players (reduce peer mesh complexity)
- Host migration if host disconnects
```

### Connection States & Error Handling

**Connection Status Indicators**:
- 🟢 Green dot = Stable connection (<50ms latency)
- 🟡 Yellow dot = Moderate lag (50-100ms)
- 🔴 Red dot = High latency (>100ms) - warning shown
- ❌ Disconnected = Player kicked, game pauses

**Reconnection Logic**:
1. Player disconnects → 10-second grace period
2. Game pauses, show "Player X disconnected, waiting..."
3. If reconnects within 10s → resume immediately
4. If timeout → vote to kick or wait (other players decide)
5. In ranked mode → disconnect = automatic forfeit

**Network Diagnostics Panel** (toggle in settings):
```
Ping: 45ms
Packet Loss: 0.2%
Your Upload: 1.2 Mbps
Hand Tracking: 60 FPS
Game State Sync: ✅ Good
```

```

**Implementation**:
- mDNS/Bonjour for local network discovery
  -- this can implement later - there will be some central server which should do this
- Advertise game as service: `_airpong._tcp.local`
- Show signal strength (WiFi icon bars)
- Auto-join if only one game found nearby

### Spectator Mode

**How Spectators Join**:
1. Enter room code with "(Spectator)" suffix: `4X7K2M-SPEC`

## Final Notes
This game succeeds by making players look RIDICULOUS while having a BLAST. The viral potential comes from:
1. Visible physical exhaustion (players sweating, arms burning)
2. Hilarious gesture moments caught on camera
3. Intense competitive drama with simple rules
4. "One more round" addiction from quick 60-second matches
5. Social shareability (replays show both game + player reactions)

The hand-tracking controls make it feel like you're PHYSICALLY IN THE GAME, not just controlling it. Your hands ARE the paddles. When you see yourself on camera desperately reaching for a save, that visceral connection creates memorable moments worth sharing.
